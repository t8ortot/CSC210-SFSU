# Cellular Automation

A program that follows a set of rules for each time-step.
Users will be able to:

1. Enter the number of columns
2. Enter the number of time steps the program should run for
3. Enter a list of indices of columns that will contain a 1 (enter negative number to finish)

Then the program will:

4. Print a “ruler” line with the specified number of columns, 0 through 9, repeating
5. Run the cellular automaton for the specified number of time steps
6. On each time step, is display the cells on one line, printing a ‘#’ if the cell contains a 1, or a space if the cell contains a 0
