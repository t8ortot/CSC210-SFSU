# HeartRateChart

Calculates a target heart rate range, between 50% and 85% of the maximum heart rate, and prints a visual table of the data.

Learned how to use final variables, for-loops, and nested for-loops.

How to run (assuming inside HeartRateChart directory):
- javac HeartRateChart.java
- java HeartRateChart

How to use:
- The program will print the data as a two dimensional chart with the ages on the x-axis, and the heart rates on the y-axis.
- The asterisks (*) on the graph represent the target range and the plus symbols (+) represent the area where the heart rate exceeds the age-specific maximum heart rate.
