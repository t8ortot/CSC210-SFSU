# HeartRateChart

This program is supposed to calculate a target heart rate range, between 50% and 85% of the maximum heart rate, given the age.

The program will then print the results as a two dimensional chart with the ages on the x-axis, and the heart rates on the y-axis.

The asterisks (*) on the graph represent the target range and the plus symbols(+) represent the area where the heart rate exceeds the age-specific maximum heart rate.
