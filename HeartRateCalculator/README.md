# HeartRateCalculator

A program that calculates whether the user's heart rate is above or below their maximum.

The program prompts the user to enter their age and current heart rate.

Then the maximum heartrate is calculated like so: (max = 220 - age).

Then the program evaluates and returns whether the user's heart rate is above, below, or equal to their calculated maximum heart rate.
