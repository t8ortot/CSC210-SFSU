# Vampire Hunt

A grid-based game where you play as a Vampire and try to find your prey in a cave. When trying to find your victim, Vampire Hunters are shooting stake arrows at you, which can inflict 0, 1, or 2 points of damage to your health points. The game ends when either: You bite your victim, or you have been shot by too many arrows.

Learned switch-case statements.

How to run (assuming in VampireHunt directory):
- javac VampireHunt.java
- java VampireHunt

How to use:
- The game will ask if you would like to cheat, which reveals your prey's location to you.
- The game will then ask for you to guess where your target is by entering coordinates.
- A map will be generated to show you where you are in the map, how far you are from your target, and if you have been hit by an arrow.
- Repeats until prey is bitten or player is hit with too many arrows.
