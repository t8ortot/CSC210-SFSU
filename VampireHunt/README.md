# Vampire Hunt

This is a grid-based game where you play as a Vampire, trying to find your prey in a cave. When trying to find your victim, Vampire Hunters are shooting stake arrows at you, which can inflict 0, 1, or 2 points of damage to your healthpoints.

The game ends when either: You bite your victim, or you have been shot by too many arrows.
