# HeartRateTable

This program is meant to print a range of target and maximum heart rates, depending on age, in a table.

The table consists of 3 columns: Age (which is incremented by 5 each row), target range, and max.

The target range is calculated as (lower = (lower bound %)(max)) and (upper = (upper bound %)(max))

The maximum is calculated  as: (max = 220 - age)
