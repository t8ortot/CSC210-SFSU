# Project 2

This program is meant to print a range of target and maximum heart rates, depending on age, as a table.

The maximum is calculated like so: (max = 220 - age)

The target range is calculated as (lower bound %)*(max) and (upper bound %)*(max)

Sample Output:

Enter target HR zone lower bound (e.g. 0.5): 0.5 

Enter target HR zone upper bound (e.g. 0.85): 0.85 

Age |     Target |  Maximum 

20  |     100-170| 200 

25  |     98-166 | 195 

30  |     95-162 | 190 

35  |     93-157 | 185 

40  |     90-153 | 180 

45  |     88-149 | 175 

50  |     85-145 | 170 

55  |     83-140 | 165 

60  |     80-136 | 160 

65  |     78-132 | 155 

70  |     75-128 | 150
