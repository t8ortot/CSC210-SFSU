# Project 1

In this project, we had to create a program that calculates whether the user's heart rate is above or below their maximum.

The program prompt the user to enter their age and current heart rate.
Then, the maximum heartrate is calculated like so: (max = 220 - age).
Then the program determines and returns whether the user's heart rate is above, below, or equal to their calculated maximum heart rate.
