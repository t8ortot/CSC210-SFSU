# Plant Growth Calculator

Takes a user input for the highest and lowest temperatures for their plant and the minimal amount of rainfall the plant requires, then predicts the height and new growth for each month based on arbitrary average temperatures and rainfall for the corresponding months.

Learned how to create and use arrays.

How to run (assuming in PlantGrowthCalculator directory):
- javac PlantGrowthCalculator.java
- java PlantGrowthCalculator

How to use:
- The program will prompt for a minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum rainfall required.
- The program will simulate the plant's growth over the next 12 months using average temperature data, starting at an arbitrary month.
- The simulation data is prints to the console, providing the month, temp, rainfall, plant growth, and current plant height for each month.
