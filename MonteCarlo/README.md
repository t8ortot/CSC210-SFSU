# Monte Carlo

Calculates an approximation of Pi by simulating the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo method involves throwing objects at a circular target (N amount of times). If the projectile hits the the target anywhere within the target, the hit counter is incremented.

Learned the Math.random and casting.

How to run (assuming in MonteCarlo directory):
- javac MonteCarlo.java
- java MonteCarlo

How to use:
- The program will run the simulation N amount of times, which is written in the code.
- After the simulation completes with will calculate its approximation with pi = (4 * hits / throws)
- The program will output its approximation of Pi.
